            This is the resource used for the BreadCrumb control. 
            <ResourceDictionary Source="\EmlEditor;component/Themes/Generic.xaml"/>  
            It would perfectly work to specify that resource like this, but unfortunately
            this would disable editing that resource by "Edit Template -> Edit current" context menu 
            in the designer for WindowDesignBreadCrumb.xaml.
            However, that designer (a.k.a Cider) could be used to edit the resource when the resource is
            specified like this: -->
                <ResourceDictionary Source="Themes\Generic.xaml"/>
            <!-- Unfortunately, this wouldn't work on runtime, because the resource is searched in 
            "EmlEditor/Themes/Generic.xaml". For that reason, we've added an extra 
            "EmlEditor/Themes/Generic.xaml" to this solution, that maps to 
            "\EmlEditor;component/Themes/Generic.xaml" using <ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
            -->
            </ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
        </ResourceDictionary>
    </Application.Resources>
</Application>
